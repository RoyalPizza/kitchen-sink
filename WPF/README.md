## Note
There are many ways to do the same thing in dotnet. This project
does not mess with alot of systems like threading, generic hosts, 
etc...

## Consider
Stuff to consider adding, but did not because I have done it
before and it is more work than I desire to add to this playground.
- Themes
- Multilang with resx files
- Threading with UI dispatches (just using async for now)
- Frame with Pages
